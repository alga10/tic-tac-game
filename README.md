Here a project for a Tic Tac Toe game, the general idea of ​​this project
is to make a game that allows me work with:

-   Getting User Input

-   Creating Functions that edit variables based on user input

-   Generating output

-   Joining User Inputs and Logic Flow

The game has the following scope:

-   2 players are able to play the game (both sitting at the same
    computer)

-   The board will be printed out every time a player makes a move

-   You should be able to accept input of the player position and then
    place a symbol on the board

-   The logic will detect if there was a winner or the game is a draw.

-   At the end of the game, users will be asked if they want to play
    again.
